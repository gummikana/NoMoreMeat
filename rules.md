No More Meat
============

A game about dietary restrictions and moral superiority.


Objective
=========

The goal is to reach 10 karma points and achieve moral superiority over the other players. You do this by not eating the foods you're restricted from eating and trying to get other players to eat their forbidden foods, while also avoiding death from starvation.


Components
==========

* 39 food cards with a green back (7 Meat, 7 Dairy, 7 Fish, 7 Eggs, 6 Broccoli, 5 Tofu) 
* 30 lifestyle cards with red back (6 No Meat, 6 No Dairy, 6 No Fish, 6 No Eggs, 4 No Broccoli, 2 No Tofu)
* 4 pan cards (1 Select, 1 Shuffle, 1 Backwards, 1 Mystery)
* 40 karma tokens with a picture of a yin yang


Setup
=====

Take the food deck and shuffle it. Deal 4 food cards to each player face down. These 4 cards are the player's starting hand.

Take the 4 pan cards and shuffle them face down. Discard the top pan card and lay the remaining 3 cards face up on the center of the table. These are the pans.

Take the lifestyle deck and shuffle it. Lay it face down beside the 3 pans. Flip the top card face up and lay it next to the deck, so all players can see it. 

Take the karma tokens and place them on the table in reach of all the players.

The starting player is the player with most real life dietary restrictions. In case of a tie, flip a coin. 

How to play
===========

No More Meat is played in turns. The starting player takes the first turn, and turns continue clockwise around the table. The game ends when any of the players gets 10 or more karma points or if only one player is left alive.


Taking a turn
-------------

On your turn, do the following in order:

1. Take karma points equal to the number of _unique_ lifestyle choices you have  -OR- draw an additional lifestyle choice card.

2. Play a food card from your hand into one of the pans. If you cannot play a card (because you have none) you die of starvation. 

3. If playing a card causes a pan to be full, it is served immediately. A pan is full if it has as many cards as the number of players + 1. 

4. If a pan has been served, consumption of cards occurs.

Your turn is over and the turn passes to the player on your left.


1. Taking karma points
-------------------

At the beginning of their turn the player may take karma points equal to the amount of _unique_ lifestyle choice cards they have (unique to them) -OR- draw an additional lifestyle choice card.

The karma points are taken from the pool and placed in front of the player, so they may be seen and counted by all the other players. 

1. Or taking a lifestyle choice
-------------------------------

When drawing a lifestyle choice card the player can take either the lifestyle choice card that is face up on the table -OR- the face down card that is on top of the lifestyle choice deck. The selected lifestyle choice card is placed face up in front of the player. Lifestyle choices are permanent and cannot be removed during the game.

After this a new lifestyle choice card is flipped up next to the lifestyle choice deck.

What if I take a face down card and I get a restriction that I already have? 
When drawing a restriction that you already have, the duplicate restriction is placed into the discard pile. You can only get karma points from unique lifestyle choice cards that you have.

2. Playing a food card
----------------------

On your turn you have to play a food card from your hand to one of the pans. If you don't have any food cards to play you die of starvation. Note that running out of cards doesn't kill you instantly, you die when you need to place a card and don't have any to place.

Place your selected food card face up on any of the pans (except in the case of Mystery pan). If there are cards on the pan already, lay it on top of them so that the previous cards can be seen. Keep the cards in the order they were placed.

When placing a card on the Mystery pan place it face down and don't show it to anyone. 

If the number of cards on a pan is equal to the number of players + 1, the pan is served immediately.

3. Serving a full pan
---------------------

A pan is served when the card that exceeds the number of players by one is played. E.g. In a 3 player game, when a pan already has 3 cards and a fourth card is played into the pan, it is served.

Follow the serving instructions of the pan (explained below). Note that unless one or more of the players have been eliminated, the player who placed the last card into the pan gets the first and last cards dealt, while everyone else gets only one.

The cards are placed face up in front of the player they were served to.

Shuffle
-------

Take the cards in the pan, turn them face down and shuffle them. Starting with the player who placed the last card into the pan, deal the cards face up clockwise around the table.

Select
------

Take the cards in the pan, keeping them face up. The player who placed the last card into the pan starts and takes any one of the cards in the pan. Then going clockwise around the table, each player selects any one of the remaining cards.

Mystery
-------

Take all the cards, keeping them in the order they were placed in the pan. Starting with the player who placed the last card into the pan, deal the cards face up one at a time to each player in clockwise order.

When placing a card into the mystery pan, do not show the card and place it face down into the pan.

Backwards
---------

Take the cards in the pan, keeping them in the order they were placed. Starting with the player who placed the last card into the pan, go around the table in _counterclockwise_ order and deal the cards to each player.

Example 
-------

In a 3 player game, Ari plays the Tofu card from his hand into the Backwards pan. The pan had 3 cards in it before, so after Ari has placed his card in it, it is served.

The backwards pan is served in counterclockwise order. Therefore Ari is served the top card (which is his Tofu). Matti, the player to Ari's right, gets the Broccoli. Kristian, the player to Matti's right, gets the Fish and the last card in the pan, Meat, is served to Ari.

4. Consumption
--------------

Once a pan has been served, the served cards are consumed by the players and the effects of the cards are applied. Consumed cards go into the discard pile.

When consuming a food that you are allowed to eat, do the following:

1. Add or subtract the number of karma points indicated on the card (if any).

2. Take the number of food cards indicated on the card (if any) from the food deck and add them to your hand.

If you must consume a card with a food that your lifestyle choices restrict you from eating, you lose all of your karma points (including any karma points you might gain from other cards in this round). Additionally, you do not get any new food cards from cards that you are restricted from eating. 


Example
-------

Ari's got 7 karma points and he is served a Broccoli and a Meat, but he has the No Meat lifestyle restriction. Because Ari has the No Meat lifestyle choice card and he's forced to eat Meat he looses all his karma points. Also he doesn't get any of food cards from the Meat. Fortunately Ari can eat the Broccoli, but unfortunately he lost all of his karma points this round, so he doesn't get the 1 karma point from Broccoli. But he gets the 1 food card added to his hand from consuming the Broccoli.

(Winning, starving)

Winning
=======



Preparations
============

Shuffle both decks and deal four (???) food cards to each player.
Flip up one lifestyle choice card and put next to that deck.

Place the three pans in the middle of the table
The pans are 
- Random, shuffle and deal face down
- Deal the pile backwards among the players
- Select what card you want out of the pile


Basic order of play
===================

1. Take karma points equal to the number of unique lifestyle choices you have  -OR- draw an additional lifestyle choice card and put in front of you. You can either pick the flipped up one or the hidden one from the top of the deck.

2. Play a food card from your hand into one of the pans. A pan is full if it has as many cards as the number of players + 1. A full pan is immediately served to all the players.


Serving
=======

The player who played the last card goes first and picks a card from the served pan. Follow the order of the pan, see above. The first player gets two cards, everyone else only one (until someone is out, then more players might get more than one card).
Some cards give or take points when played (purple circle).
Some cards let you draw more cards (green rectangle).
If you eat something that you have promised not to eat (with a lifestyle choice) you lose all your points and donï¿½t earn any points from cards that round (or did you earn points???). You never lose any lifestyle choices.
If the deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to make a new deck.

Death
=====

If you ever run out of cards in hand you starve to death. The player count never goes down though, so pans still require the original number of cards to become full.
