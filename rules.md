No More Meat
============

A game of dietary restrictions and being morally superior than all the other players.


Objective
---------

The goal is to reach 10 karma points and become a carrot. You do this by refusing to eat certain foods and forcing other players to eat what they're not supposed to eat. 


Components
----------

* 39 food cards with a green back (7 Meat, 7 Dairy, 7 Fish, 7 Eggs, 6 Broccoli, 5 Tofu) 
* 30 lifestyle cards with red back (6 No Meat, 6 No Dairy, 6 No Fish, 6 No Eggs, 4 No Broccoli, 2 No Tofu)
* 4 pan cards (1 Select, 1 Shuffle, 1 Backwards, 1 Mystery)
* 40 karma tokens with a picture of a carrot


Setup
-----

Take the 4 pan cards and shuffle them face down. Discard the top pan card and lay the 3 cards face up on the center of the table. 

Take the lifestyle deck and shuffle it. Lay it face down beside the 3 pans. Flip the top card face up and lay it next to the deck, so all players can see it.

Take the food deck and shuffle it. Deal 4 food cards face down to each player. 

Take the karma tokens and place them on the table in reach of all the players.

The starting player is the player with most real life dietary restrictions. In case of a tie, flip a coin. 


Basic order of play
-------------------

On player's turn they do the following:

1. Take karma points equal to the number of _unique_ lifestyle choices you have  -OR- draw an additional lifestyle choice card and put in front of you. You can either pick the flipped up one or the hidden one from the top of the deck.

2. Play a food card from your hand into one of the pans. A pan is full if it has as many cards as the number of players + 1. A full pan is immediately served to all the players (See serving). 

The turn is over and next player (clockwise) takes their turn. 


(Winning, starving)

Winning
=======



Preparations
============

Shuffle both decks and deal four (???) food cards to each player.
Flip up one lifestyle choice card and put next to that deck.

Place the three pots in the middle of the table
The pots are 
- Random, shuffle and deal face down
- Deal the pile backwards among the players
- Select what card you want out of the pile


Basic order of play
===================

1. Take karma points equal to the number of unique lifestyle choices you have  -OR- draw an additional lifestyle choice card and put in front of you. You can either pick the flipped up one or the hidden one from the top of the deck.

2. Play a food card from your hand into one of the pots. A pot is full if it has as many cards as the number of players + 1. A full pot is immediately served to all the players.


Serving
=======

The player who played the last card goes first and picks a card from the served pot. Follow the order of the pot, see above. The first player gets two cards, everyone else only one (until someone is out, then more players might get more than one card).
Some cards give or take points when played (purple circle).
Some cards let you draw more cards (green rectangle).
If you eat something that you have promised not to eat (with a lifestyle choice) you lose all your points and don’t earn any points from cards that round (or did you earn points???). You never lose any lifestyle choices.
If the deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to make a new deck.

Death
=====

If you ever run out of cards in hand you starve to death. The player count never goes down though, so pots still require the original number of cards to become full.
